# Progress View Loading Issues - Analysis and Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Task Cancellation Errors**:

   - Error: `Swift.CancellationError error 1`
   - The ProgressView was crashing due to improper handling of task cancellations during view transitions
   - Tasks were being immediately cancelled when the view disappeared or during tab switches

2. **Lifecycle Management Problems**:

   - Tasks were being created on every appearance, potentially leading to multiple concurrent tasks
   - The view wasn't properly cleaning up tasks when disappearing
   - `hasLoadedOnce` flag wasn't consistently maintained

3. **Error Handling Gaps**:
   - `CancellationError` wasn't being properly caught and handled
   - Errors during data loading could leave the view in an inconsistent state

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Improved Task Management in ProgressView

```swift
// Before:
loadTask?.cancel()
// New:
// Use async cancellation to avoid immediate termination
Task {
    loadTask?.cancel()
    loadTask = nil
}
```

- Added proper task cancellation at the beginning of `onAppear` to prevent multiple concurrent tasks
- Wrapped cancellation in `onDisappear` in a `Task` to avoid immediate termination
- Added additional cancellation checks to ensure state remains consistent

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

```swift
// Before:
catch is CancellationError {
    // Safely handle task cancellation
    print("Progress loading task was cancelled")
}

// After:
catch is CancellationError {
    // Safely handle task cancellation - just ignore it
    print("Progress loading task was cancelled")
    // Don't reset hasLoadedOnce on error to prevent repeated attempts
}
```

- Properly handled `CancellationError` in the ProgressView
- Added explicit comment to avoid resetting `hasLoadedOnce` flag during errors
- Ensured error handling doesn't affect the view's state

### 3. Fixed ProgressDashboardViewModel

```swift
// Before:
if Task.isCancelled {
    print("ProgressDashboardViewModel - Task was cancelled during delay")
    timeoutTask.cancel()
    await MainActor.run {
        self.isLoading = false
    }
    return
}

// After:
try Task.checkCancellation()
```

- Replaced manual cancellation checks with proper `Task.checkCancellation()`
- Added dedicated catch clause for `CancellationError`
- Ensured the ViewModel's state is properly reset after task cancellation

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue was that the task cancellation wasn't being properly handled during view transitions. When switching tabs or navigating within the app, tasks were being cancelled abruptly without proper cleanup, leading to unhandled `CancellationError` exceptions.

The fixes ensure that:

1. Task cancellations are handled gracefully
2. The view's state remains consistent regardless of when tasks are cancelled
3. Proper checks ensure we don't try to update state after cancellation
4. The loading state is properly reset even when tasks are cancelled

This should resolve the issue where the Progress View fails to load due to task cancellation errors.
