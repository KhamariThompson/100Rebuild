# Authentication and Network Connectivity Fixes Summary

Below is a summary of all fixes implemented:

## 1. Network Connectivity Monitoring and Handling

- Added network monitoring in `AuthViewModel` to track connection status
- Added network status display in the UI to inform users when offline
- Implemented retry mechanism for auth operations when network reconnects
- Added a reconnection success message to inform users when connectivity is restored
- Enabled automatic retrying of failed operations when connectivity is restored

## 2. Improved Firebase and Authentication Error Handling

- Enhanced error handling in `FirebaseService` with specific error messages for common failures
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff for Firestore operations
- Implemented queue for storing operations that should be retried when network connection returns
- Added specific Firebase Auth error parsing to display meaningful error messages to users
- Created proper offline mode with cache handling in the Firestore service

## 3. Fixed Layout Constraint Issues

- Fixed SystemInputAssistantView constraint conflicts by lowering priority instead of disabling constraints
- Used a more compatible approach to handle keyboard-related constraints
- Removed problematic keyboard handlers that were disrupting text input by toggling focus
- Implemented proper keyboard dismissal without interfering with text entry
- Created recursive view search to find and fix constraint issues throughout the view hierarchy

## 4. UI Enhancements for Better UX

- Added visual feedback for network status (indicator at top of authentication screen)
- Improved the LoadingOverlay to show different states based on network connectivity
- Disabled authentication controls when offline to prevent failed operation attempts
- Added proper form validation feedback with disabled buttons when fields are invalid
- Implemented visual styling to indicate interactive elements' disabled states

## 5. Firebase Configuration and Initialization Improvements

- Added `configureIfNeeded()` method to ensure Firebase is initialized before operations
- Implemented better error handling for missing Firebase configuration
- Enhanced cache settings management to prevent data loading issues
- Added proper cleanup for Firebase listeners and network monitors
- Created network status event notifications to coordinate responses across the app

## 6. Enhanced Profile Data Loading

- Implemented cache-first strategy for profile data during network outages
- Added proper error recovery for missing profile data
- Created retry mechanism for profile photo loading
- Enhanced user session state management to handle network transitions
- Added error messaging for profile loading failures

## 100DaysRebuild App Issue Fixes

### 1. DirectAuthService.swift

- Fixed the `credential` method call for Apple Sign In by updating from the deprecated method `credential(withProviderID:idToken:rawNonce:)` to the recommended `credential(providerID:idToken:rawNonce:)` method.

### 2. AuthViewModel.swift

- Fixed "Publishing changes from within view updates is not allowed" warnings:
  - Refactored `validateForm()` method to calculate validation state without updating @Published properties
  - Created a separate `updateValidationState()` method to update the published properties outside of view updates
- Fixed memory capture issues:
  - Resolved "Capture of 'self' in a closure that outlives deinit" warning by using a weak self reference pattern
  - Used a local variable for the handler to avoid capturing self in a Task that outlives deinit
  - Improved initialization of authStateDidChangeHandler to avoid memory leaks

### 3. ChallengesViewModel.swift

- Fixed "No 'async' operations occur within 'await' expression" warnings:
  - Updated `Task.sleep` calls to use the newer `.sleep(for: .milliseconds(x))` API instead of nanoseconds
  - Ensured all Task.sleep operations are properly awaited
- Fixed "Passing argument of non-sendable type '[AnyHashable : Any]'" warning:
  - Created a proper Sendable struct to pass data to the Task.detached closure
  - Converted the Sendable struct to a dictionary inside the detached Task

### 4. OnboardingView.swift

- Fixed "Value 'nonce' was defined but never used" warning:
  - Modified the guard statement to check if nonce is nil rather than binding it to a local variable

## Root Cause of Blank Screen

The main cause of the blank white screen was likely the runtime errors from "Publishing changes from within view updates". When SwiftUI detects state updates during rendering, it can cause an infinite update loop, resulting in undefined behavior. This often manifests as a blank or frozen screen.

## Next Steps

1. Verify the app builds successfully without warnings
2. Run the app to confirm the blank screen issue is resolved
3. Review any new behavior to ensure it matches the expected functionality

These changes provide a more robust authentication experience with better error handling, improved network resilience, and a more user-friendly interface during connectivity issues.
