# App Icon Update Complete

The app has been updated with the new app icons from appicon.co.

## Changes Made:

- Replaced all icon files in Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset
- Backed up old icon files (just in case) to Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset.bak
- Removed all previous app icon generation files

## New Icon Details:

- All standard iOS sizes are included (29px to 1024px)
- The icon fills the entire space with no borders
- Proper Contents.json file with all required metadata

## To See Changes:

1. Delete the app from your device first
2. Clean the Xcode build folder (Product > Clean Build Folder)
3. Rebuild and reinstall the app

The icons should now display properly with no white borders or padding issues.
