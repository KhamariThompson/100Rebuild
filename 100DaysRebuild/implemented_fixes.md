# Implemented Fixes

## Firebase Initialization Fixes

- **Proper Firebase Configuration**: Fixed Firebase initialization in AppDelegate to ensure it happens before any Firebase services are accessed.
- **Reliable Firebase Detection**: Added logic to verify Firebase is properly initialized and configured before use.
- **Offline Persistence**: Configured Firestore with proper offline persistence settings (100MB cache).
- **Firestore Connectivity Monitoring**: Added special connectivity handling for Firestore with DNS resolution checks.
- **Recovery from DNS Issues**: Implemented automatic reconnection logic when "firestore.googleapis.com" DNS resolution fails.

## Network Connectivity Improvements

- **Enhanced NetworkMonitor**: Added advanced network state detection with interface type checking and DNS resolution.
- **Firestore-specific Connectivity**: Added specific monitoring for Firestore connections separate from general network state.
- **Periodic Network Checks**: Implemented regular validation of connectivity state every 30 seconds.
- **DNS Resolution Troubleshooting**: Added specific handling for DNS resolution issues that were causing Firebase connectivity problems.

## RevenueCat Configuration Fixes

- **Proper Initialization Order**: Configured RevenueCat after Firebase to ensure proper dependency initialization.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added custom error handler to properly log and suppress expected errors.
- **Retry Logic for Offerings**: Added retry mechanism for offerings that fail to load initially.
- **Fallback Pricing**: Implemented robust fallback mechanism when RevenueCat offerings aren't configured.
- **Proper User Identification**: Fixed user identification with RevenueCat to ensure proper subscription tracking.

## Authentication Service Fixes

- **Robust User Session Management**: Improved error handling and state management in UserSession.
- **Apple Sign In Error Fixes**: Added handling for "No active account" error from Apple Authentication Services.
- **Safe User Profile Loading**: Added network and availability checks before loading user profiles.

## UI/Layout Fixes

- **Input Assistant Constraint Fixes**: Fixed SystemInputAssistantView constraint issues causing CGAffineTransformInvert errors.
- **Apple Sign In Button Constraints**: Fixed constraints on ASAuthorizationAppleIDButton.
- **Navigation Bar Appearance**: Standardized navigation bar appearance settings.

## Other Improvements

- **Improved Logging**: Enhanced debug logging for network status, Firebase configuration, and RevenueCat operations.
- **Error Resilience**: Made the app more resilient to transient errors, especially during startup.

## Known Issues

- RevenueCat offerings configuration may still require setup from the RevenueCat dashboard.
- In extremely poor network conditions, the initial Firestore connection might still time out, but the retry logic will recover.

## Fix 1: Firebase Initialization Issues

- Moved Firebase configuration to the AppDelegate's didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
- Set up proper Firestore offline persistence with unlimited cache size
- Added Firebase initialization state tracking via UserDefaults
- Created FirebaseAvailabilityService for app-wide monitoring of Firebase status
- Added retry and timeout mechanisms for Firebase initialization
- Improved network monitoring for Firebase reconnection handling

## Fix 2: Firebase Service Improvements

- Implemented FirebaseAvailabilityService for centralized status monitoring
- Added recovery mechanisms for temporary network failures
- Improved error handling for Firebase service failures
- Modified Firestore operations to use proper offline mode

## Fix 3: Check-In Process Issues

- Fixed submission handling to prevent data loss
- Improved error recovery during check-in process
- Added offline support with pending operations queue

## Fix 4: Progress Loading Issues

- Enhanced ProgressViewModel with timeout and retry mechanisms
- Improved UI with better loading states and offline indicators
- Added proper error handling and recovery for network failures
- Fixed document parsing to be more resilient to data format issues
- Implemented network monitoring with auto-retry on reconnection
- Added proper use of Firestore cache for offline viewing

## Fix 5: Layout Constraint Issues

- Fixed SystemInputAssistantView constraints that were causing errors
- Implemented a safer approach to handling keyboard constraints
- Added proper priority adjustment instead of constraint removal
- Created a more robust NavigationBar appearance configuration

## Fix 6: Profile Photo Upload System

- Implemented a modular profile photo upload system with camera and photo library support
- Added proper image caching using NSCache and URLCache for better performance
- Enhanced error handling for upload failures with user-friendly error messages
- Implemented efficient image processing with resizing, cropping and compression
- Added consistent UI feedback with loading indicators and success animations
- Ensured profile photos persist across app views through UserSession updates
- Created a reusable photo source picker with better UI integration

## Auto Layout Constraint Fixes (May 19, 2023)

### Issues Fixed

- Fixed recurring Auto Layout constraint warnings about `UIView-Encapsulated-Layout-Height == 0`
- Fixed `CGAffineTransformInvert: singular matrix` errors
- Resolved conflicting constraints involving `SwiftUI.UIKitNavigationBar` and `UIFocusContainerGuide`
- Eliminated repeated constraint breakage warnings in the console

### Implementation Details

1. **Fixed NavigationView Nesting**

   - Removed nested NavigationViews in tab content
   - Applied a single NavigationView at the MainAppView level
   - Updated tab wrapper views to avoid duplicating navigation contexts

2. **Improved SettingsView Presentation**

   - Fixed app freezing when tapping settings gear icon in ProfileView
   - Used withAppDependencies() instead of creating multiple new environment objects
   - Prevents creation of duplicate ThemeManager instances

3. **Enhanced Sheet Presentations**

   - Created a new fixedSheet modifier for consistent sheet presentations
   - Automatically applies proper environment objects and navigation fixes
   - Prevents layout conflicts between sheets and navigation views

4. **Added Layout Healing Modifiers**

   - Added FixNavigationLayoutModifier to enforce proper layout rules
   - Created SafeAreaKey PreferenceKey for dynamic safe area handling
   - Implemented GeometryReader techniques to respect device safe areas

5. **Refactored ProgressView Layout**
   - Removed unnecessary nested NavigationView
   - Improved header layout with dynamic spacing
   - Fixed analytics button presentation

These changes eliminated the repeating layout constraint warnings by addressing structural issues in the navigation hierarchy and ensuring proper dependency injection patterns.
