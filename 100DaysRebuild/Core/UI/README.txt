# Design System Documentation

This file contains documentation for the 100Days design system.
To avoid build issues, the original README.md has been renamed to README.md.bak.
Please reference this file for design system documentation.

The design system consists of:

- AppSpacing for standardized spacing
- AppTypography for consistent font styles
- AppColors for semantic color tokens
- ThemeManager for light/dark mode support
- Reusable components (Cards, Buttons, etc.)

See DesignGuide.swift for detailed examples of each component.
