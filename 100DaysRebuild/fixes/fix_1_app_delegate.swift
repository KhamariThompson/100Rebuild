// Fix 1: AppDelegate Firebase initialization
// This fix resolves Firebase initialization issues:
// 1. Ensures Firebase is initialized properly in AppDelegate before any other Firebase-related code
// 2. Configures Firestore for offline persistence with proper cache settings
// 3. Removes duplicate initialization in App100Days init that was causing conflicts
// 4. Adds retry and recovery mechanism in case initialization fails
// 5. Improves network monitoring and reconnection handling
